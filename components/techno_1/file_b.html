            <h1>A Human Body Mathematical Model Biometric Using Golden Ratio</h1>
            
             <p>This research is based on two published papers [16, 17] pertaining to same subject by the same author. The research identifies more than 35 measurements and proportions to be used in modeling a human body on computers. The 35 measurements rules are based on Vitruvian Man and Neufert descriptions of Bauentwurfslehre by Ernst Neufert [20] and Leonardo da Vincicirca both based on the golden proportion notion. First, the research gives an introduction about golden proportion known also as golden section. Then, in the second section, the research explains the three dimensions of golden proportion: mathematically, geometrically, and arithmetically. The third section of the research presents the work of FIBONACCI and his series in the golden proportion.</p>

             <p>  Followed by a discussion of the geometry of Golden ratio and the essential proportions in Vitruvian Man, in the fourth section, where 15 essential proportions are explained based on the Vitruvian Man. In fifth section, BAUENTWURFSLEHRE by ERNST NEUFERT [20] is further explained with circle geometry and 29 golden proportions are reflected in the work. In the sixth section, the face and hand proportions in relation to the golden proportion are further explained. Based on the findings of the previous sections, the seventh section suggests two algorithms to be used when building a human body model. Thereby, presenting more than 35 proportions and measurements used to model human body model along with a simple algorithm that calculates exact measurements. As such, the research facilitates and explains for the human modeler the process of human modeling in multimedia arena. Hence, this research will be a spring board for researchers, practitioners in human modeling in multimedia field.</p>
             
             <p>Dubbed by the Greeks, “Golden Ratio” is a mathematical relation and proportion, where the length to width of a rectangle proportion is 1:1.61803398874989484820, such proportion is most suited for human eye and is used by architects, artists, sculptures in their work. While the Golden Ration does not embody every structure or pattern in the universe, yet, historically, this ratio emerged in Great Pyramid of Giza/Khufu/Cheops (2560 BC) [21], and in Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci and Neufert. More notably, in today’s multimedia, Golden Ratio is used in many applications: plastic surgery simulation software, animation software, art, architecture, sculpture, anatomy. A close exploration of such divine proportion and the related applications, offers opportunities to connect an understanding the conceptions of ratio and proportion to the geometry, proportions, and ratio related to the Vitruvian Man and its relation to Bauentwurfslehre by Ernst Neufert </p>
